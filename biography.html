            <p class="bioparagraphs">
                Snorri was born to Sjulfar Yngvarsson and Siggi Mikkilsdottir
                in approximately the year 832 AD, in a small village in
                southern Sweden. It was said that all the moose
                in the land gathered to see him, and speak their blessings over
                him. Snorri could ski and drink a whole mug of beer by the time
                he was six years old, and could drink a whole barrel by thirteen.
                It was around this time that he began conversing with moose, and 
                learning all their wise secrets.

            <p class="bioparagraphs">
                Snorri first went <i> viking </i> in his seventeenth year. It was
                said that he traveled across the sea not in a drakkar, but on 
                the back of a moose. He killed the most Saxons and took the most
                gold of anyone that year. Snorri would summon moose to his side
                by shouting in their tongue, and make glorious battle with the 
                Christians. His other deeds include, but are not limited to:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li> Riding to the North Pole on a moose                </li>
                <li> Spending the most time in a sauna (154 days)       </li>
                <li> Growing a magnificent mane of hair                 </li>
                <li> Eating more surstromming than anyone in history    </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="death"> The Death of Snorri Sjulfarsson </h3>
            <p class="bioparagraphs">
                It was in his eightieth year when Snorri fell off of a table
                while dancing, and sadly broke his neck. It was a truly
                pitiful end to the life of a great man. They say that the moose
                came and carried his body away in their antlers, though no one 
                knows where they brought him.
